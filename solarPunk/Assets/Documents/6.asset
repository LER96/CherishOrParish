  documentTitle: Free Fashion Creativity
  documentStart: 'While it is known that the limitations on production, intensive
    mining and harvesting of materials have improved the health of our planet, we
    as a society have lost our creative spark for it. We must return to more efficient
    production of textile, so that each human has the right to express themselves
    in a way they feel comfortable. '
  documentmMiddle: "We need: \u2014Allow the construction of additional textile factories
    \u2014Reduce the heavy existing tax on new clothing items "
  documentEnd: "We will make sure that the profits from the renewed sales will go
    towards your office for important ecological causes. Don\u2019t withhold people's
    right to express themselves! Bianca Lindsey, Founder of Lindsey\u2019s Secret "
